# Convert SAR Templates to Common Data Element Sets

This project aims to automate the process of converting the radiology reporting templates from the Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR) to ACR/RSNA Common Data Element Sets. The goal is to streamline the process of data conversion and ensure consistency and accuracy in the data sets.

## Source Data

The source data for this project is the radiology reporting templates provided by the Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR). More information about these templates can be found on the [SAR website](https://abdominalradiology.org).

## Target Data

The target data format for this project is the ACR/RSNA Common Data Element Sets. These data sets are designed to standardize the reporting of radiology data. More information about these data sets can be found on the [radelement.org repository](https://radelement.org).

## Conversion Process

The conversion process involves using a Language Model (LLM) to automate the conversion of the SAR templates into the ACR/RSNA format. This involves mapping the elements in the SAR templates to the corresponding elements in the ACR/RSNA data sets.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the development phase. The current focus is on developing the LLM and testing its ability to accurately convert the SAR templates into the ACR/RSNA format.
